## What is this?

DashLint is an open **rulebook** that any AI coding assistant can read
automatically. It teaches the assistant how to build dashboards that look
like a human designer made them — not like an AI's first draft.

**46 rules** across 7 categories, every one derived from decisions made in
production React analytics dashboards (incident management &
contact-center SLA).

| Category       | Prefix         | What it covers |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Color system   | `R-COLOR-*`    | Semantic status colors, chart palette ordering, hue limits |
| Spacing        | `R-SPACE-*`    | Card padding, grid gaps, chart-to-card margins |
| Typography     | `R-TYPE-*`     | Dual-font pairing, tabular-nums, fluid KPI sizing |
| Chart selection| `R-CHART-*`    | Data shape → chart type, pie-chart avoidance, animation |
| Layout         | `R-LAYOUT-*`   | KPI-above-charts hierarchy, sidebar, grid, drawers vs overlays |
| Interaction    | `R-INTERACT-*` | Cross-filtering, clickable charts, keyboard shortcuts |
| States         | `R-STATE-*`    | Loading, empty, and error state patterns |

## Quick Start

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop

```bash
# Install via plugin marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add dashlint
```

### Any AI assistant (Cursor, ChatGPT/Codex, Windsurf, etc.)

Point your assistant at this repo's `/skill/SKILL.md`:

```
https://github.com/tanmay-kalbande/dashlint/blob/main/skill/SKILL.md
```

Or clone and reference locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanmay-kalbande/dashlint.git
# Then tell your AI: "Use the skill at ./dashlint/skill/SKILL.md"
```

### MCP Server (zero install)

If your AI client supports MCP (Model Context Protocol), you can connect to
the hosted server instead — no cloning needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dashlint": {
      "url": "https://dashlint.vercel.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

→ See [dashlint-mcp](https://github.com/tanmay-kalbande/dashlint-mcp) for
the server source.

## Principles

- **No AI keys** — DashLint never calls an LLM and never stores API keys
- **No signup** — fully open, no authentication
- **Real rules** — every rule comes from production projects, not generic advice
- **Data-driven defaults, not hard bans** — rules explain *why*, so the AI
  can reason about exceptions when the context genuinely warrants one

## Contributing

The rulebook lives in `/rulebook/`. Edit there — `reference.md` is compiled
from it. PRs welcome for new rules, corrections, or before/after examples.
